# Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains my Power BI dashboard project as part of my personal portfolio. The Power BI dashboard is designed to showcase my skills in data visualization, analysis, and storytelling using Power BI.

## About the Project

The Power BI dashboard project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in creating visually appealing and insightful data dashboards. The project incorporates various datasets and presents them in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration**: The dashboard integrates multiple data sources, such as Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, or SQL databases, to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
- **Data Transformation**: I have utilized Power Query and M language to perform data cleaning, transformation, and shaping, ensuring the data is in the desired format for visualization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The dashboard includes a variety of interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, maps, and tables, to present the data in a visually appealing and engaging manner.
- **Filters and Slicers**: Users can explore the data dynamically by using filters and slicers, enabling them to drill down into specific segments or time periods of interest.
- **Insightful Analysis**: The dashboard incorporates data analysis techniques, such as trend analysis, correlation analysis, and KPI tracking, to derive meaningful insights and highlight key findings.
- **Storytelling**: The dashboard tells a data-driven story by presenting the data in a logical and narrative manner, guiding users through the insights and conclusions.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**: The dashboard project is developed using Power BI Desktop, a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations and reports.
- **Power Query**: Power Query is used for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping operations to prepare the data for visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: DAX is utilized for creating calculated columns, measures, and complex calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.
- **Power BI Service**: The dashboard can be deployed and shared using Power BI Service, enabling collaboration and access to the dashboard from any device.
